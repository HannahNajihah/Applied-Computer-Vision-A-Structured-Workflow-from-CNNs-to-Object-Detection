# Applied Computer Vision: A Structured Workflow from CNNs to Object Detection

This project demonstrates a structured progression in computer vision, starting with **image classification** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), advancing through **image preprocessing and augmentation** using OpenCV, and culminating in **object detection** with a pretrained YOLO/Faster R-CNN model.  

The workflow bridges theoretical understanding with practical applications, building end-to-end expertise in computer vision.

## üîé Project Structure

### Part 1: Image Classification with CNN (Fashion MNIST)
- Built a **Convolutional Neural Network** to classify clothing images into ten categories.  
- Applied **data preprocessing** and visualisation for model understanding.  
- Evaluated model performance with metrics including accuracy and classification reports.  

### Part 2: Image Preprocessing and Augmentation (OpenCV)
- Implemented **key computer vision techniques** such as resizing, rotation, shifting, blurring, and edge detection.  
- Applied **contrast enhancement and grayscale conversion** to improve data quality.  
- Showcased how preprocessing supports **better generalisation** in deep learning workflows.  

### Part 3: Object Detection with Pretrained Model (TensorFlow Hub)
- Applied **transfer learning** using a pretrained Faster R-CNN model.  
- Performed **real-world object detection** on complex images with multiple labels.  
- Implemented **bounding box visualisation** to highlight detected objects and confidence scores.
